### Hi, I’m Edward Chung
I am a designer-turned-frontend developer who is passionate about building delightful and accessible web experiences. I love learning and embracing new technologies, having taught myself HTML, CSS, Javascript, SEO, React, NextJS, D3.js and the latest technologies. 

My unique blend of skills in design and coding allow me to create creative and engaging UI for websites and applications with attention to details. I love to work in fast-moving environments with a mission to making this world a better place - one component at a time.

I have completed several real-world projects with hundreds of active users every day such as [Octoprice](https://octopriceuk.vercel.app/) and [Nextrains](https://nextrains.netlify.app/)
